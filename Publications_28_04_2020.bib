	abstract = {Early-infantile encephalopathies with epilepsy are devastating conditions mandating an accurate diagnosis to guide proper management. Whole-exome sequencing was used to investigate the disease etiology in four children from independent families with intellectual disability and epilepsy, revealing bi-allelic GOT2 mutations. In-depth metabolic studies in individual 1 showed low plasma serine, hypercitrullinemia, hyperlactatemia, and hyperammonemia. The epilepsy was serine and pyridoxine responsive. Functional consequences of observed mutations were tested by measuring enzyme activity and by cell and animal models. Zebrafish and mouse models were used to validate brain developmental and functional defects and to test therapeutic strategies. GOT2 encodes the mitochondrial glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase. GOT2 enzyme activity was deficient in fibroblasts with bi-allelic mutations. GOT2, a member of the malate-aspartate shuttle, plays an essential role in the intracellular NAD(H) redox balance. De novo serine biosynthesis was impaired in fibroblasts with GOT2 mutations and GOT2-knockout HEK293 cells. Correcting the highly oxidized cytosolic NAD-redox state by pyruvate supplementation restored serine biosynthesis in GOT2-deficient cells. Knockdown of got2a in zebrafish resulted in a brain developmental defect associated with seizure-like electroencephalography spikes, which could be rescued by supplying pyridoxine in embryo water. Both pyridoxine and serine synergistically rescued embryonic developmental defects in zebrafish got2a morphants. The two treated individuals reacted favorably to their treatment. Our data provide a mechanistic basis for the biochemical abnormalities in GOT2 deficiency that may also hold for other MAS defects.},

	abstract = {Huntington disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Although the length of this repeat is inversely correlated with age of onset (AOO), it does not fully explain the variability in AOO. We assessed the sequence downstream of the CAG repeat in HTT [reference: (CAG)n-CAA-CAG], since variants within this region have been previously described, but no study of AOO has been performed. These analyses identified a variant that results in complete loss of interrupting (LOI) adenine nucleotides in this region [(CAG)n-CAG-CAG]. Analysis of multiple HD pedigrees showed that this LOI variant is associated with dramatically earlier AOO (average of 25 years) despite the same polyglutamine length as in individuals with the interrupting penultimate CAA codon. This LOI allele is particularly frequent in persons with reduced penetrance alleles who manifest with HD and increases the likelihood of presenting clinically with HD with a CAG of 36-39 repeats. Further, we show that the LOI variant is associated with increased somatic repeat instability, highlighting this as a significant driver of this effect. These findings indicate that the number of uninterrupted CAG repeats, which is lengthened by the LOI, is the most significant contributor to AOO of HD and is more significant than polyglutamine length, which is not altered in these individuals. In addition, we identified another variant in this region, where the CAA-CAG sequence is duplicated, which was associated with later AOO. Identification of these cis-acting modifiers have potentially important implications for genetic counselling in HD-affected families.},

	abstract = {Although previous research identified candidate genetic polymorphisms associated with cisplatin nephrotoxicity, varying outcome definitions potentially contributed to the variability in the effect size and direction of this relationship. We selected genetic variants that have been significantly associated with cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in more than one published study (SLC22A2 rs316019; ERCC1 rs11615 and rs3212986; ERCC2 rs1799793 and rs13181) and performed a replication analysis to confirm associations between these genetic polymorphisms and cisplatin nephrotoxicity using various outcome definitions. We included 282 germ cell testicular cancer patients treated with cisplatin from 2009-2014, aged {\textgreater}17 years recruited by the Canadian Pharmacogenomics Network for Drug Safety. Nephrotoxicity was defined using four grading tools: (1) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03 for acute kidney injury (AKI) or CTCAE-AKI; (2) adjusted cisplatin-induced AKI; (3) elevation of serum creatinine; and (4) reduction in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Significant associations were only found when using the CTCAE v4.03 definition: genotype CA of the ERCC1 rs3212986 was associated with decreased risk of cisplatin nephrotoxicity (ORadj = 0.24; 95\% CI:0.08-0.70; p= 0.009) compared to genotype CC. In contrast, addition of allele A at SLC22A2 rs316019 was associated with increased risk (ORadj = 4.41; 95\% CI:1.96-9.88; p {\textless} 0.001) while genotype AC was associated with a higher risk of cisplatin nephrotoxicity (ORadj = 5.06; 95\% CI:1.69-15.16; p= 0.004) compared to genotype CC. Our study showed that different case definitions led to variability in the genetic risk ascertainment of cisplatin nephrotoxicity.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Individuals with deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 (DADA2), a recently recognized autosomal recessive disease, present with various systemic vascular and inflammatory manifestations, often with young age at disease onset or with early onset of recurrent strokes. Their clinical features and histologic findings overlap with those of childhood-onset polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), a primary "idiopathic" systemic vasculitis. Despite similar clinical presentation, individuals with DADA2 may respond better to biologic therapy than to traditional immunosuppression. The aim of this study was to screen an international registry of children with systemic primary vasculitis for variants in ADA2.
METHODS: The coding exons of ADA2 were sequenced in 60 children and adolescents with a diagnosis of PAN, cutaneous PAN, or unclassifiable vasculitis (UCV), any chronic vasculitis with onset at age 5 years or younger, or history of stroke. The functional consequences of the identified variants were assessed by ADA2 enzyme assay and immunoblotting.
RESULTS: Nine children with DADA2 (5 with PAN, 3 with UCV, and 1 with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis) were identified. Among them, 1 patient had no rare variants in the coding region of ADA2 and 8 had biallelic, rare variants (minor allele frequency {\textless}0.01) with a known association with DADA2 (p.Gly47Arg and p.Gly47Ala) or a novel association (p.Arg9Trp, p.Leu351Gln, and p.Ala357Thr). The clinical phenotype varied widely.
CONCLUSION: These findings support previous observations indicating that DADA2 has extensive genotypic and phenotypic variability. Thus, screening ADA2 among children with vasculitic rash, UCV, PAN, or unexplained, early-onset central nervous system disease with systemic inflammation may enable an earlier diagnosis of DADA2.},

	abstract = {Biallelic pathogenic variants in PLPBP (formerly called PROSC) have recently been shown to cause a novel form of vitamin B6-dependent epilepsy, the pathophysiological basis of which is poorly understood. When left untreated, the disease can progress to status epilepticus and death in infancy. Here we present 12 previously undescribed patients and six novel pathogenic variants in PLPBP. Suspected clinical diagnoses prior to identification of PLPBP variants included mitochondrial encephalopathy (two patients), folinic acid-responsive epilepsy (one patient) and a movement disorder compatible with AADC deficiency (one patient). The encoded protein, PLPHP is believed to be crucial for B6 homeostasis. We modelled the pathogenicity of the variants and developed a clinical severity scoring system. The most severe phenotypes were associated with variants leading to loss of function of PLPBP or significantly affecting protein stability/PLP-binding. To explore the pathophysiology of this disease further, we developed the first zebrafish model of PLPHP deficiency using CRISPR/Cas9. Our model recapitulates the disease, with plpbp-/- larvae showing behavioural, biochemical, and electrophysiological signs of seizure activity by 10 days post-fertilization and early death by 16 days post-fertilization. Treatment with pyridoxine significantly improved the epileptic phenotype and extended lifespan in plpbp-/- animals. Larvae had disruptions in amino acid metabolism as well as GABA and catecholamine biosynthesis, indicating impairment of PLP-dependent enzymatic activities. Using mass spectrometry, we observed significant B6 vitamer level changes in plpbp-/- zebrafish, patient fibroblasts and PLPHP-deficient HEK293 cells. Additional studies in human cells and yeast provide the first empirical evidence that PLPHP is localized in mitochondria and may play a role in mitochondrial metabolism. These models provide new insights into disease mechanisms and can serve as a platform for drug discovery.},

Inborn errors of pyrimidine metabolism affecting enzymes in the pyrimidine de novo and degradation pathway have been identified but no patients have been described with a deficiency in proteins affecting the cellular import of ribonucleosides. In this manuscript, we report the elucidation of the genetic basis of the observed uridine-cytidineuria in a patient presenting with fever, hepatosplenomegaly, persistent lactate acidosis, severely disturbed liver enzymes and ultimately multi-organ failure. Sequence analysis of genes encoding proteins directly involved in the metabolism of uridine and cytidine showed two variants c.1528C {\textgreater} T (p.R510C) and c.1682G {\textgreater} A (p.R561Q) in SLC28A1, encoding concentrative nucleotide transporter 1 (hCNT1). Functional analysis showed that these variants affected the three-dimensional structure of hCNT1, altered glycosylation and decreased the half-life of the mutant proteins which resulted in impaired transport activity. Co-transfection of both variants, mimicking the trans disposition of c.1528C {\textgreater} T (p.R510C) and c.1682G {\textgreater} A (p.R561Q) in the patient, significantly impaired hCNT1 biological function. Whole genome sequencing identified two pathogenic variants c.50delT; p.(Leu17Argfs*34) and c.853\_855del; p.(Lys285del) in the PRF1 gene, indicating that our patient was also suffering from Familial Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis type 2. The identification of two co-existing monogenic defects might have resulted in a blended phenotype. Thus, the clinical presentation of isolated hCNT1 deficiency remains to be established.},

The importance of sialic acid biosynthesis in human physiology is well illustrated by the severe metabolic disorders in this pathway. However, the biological role of sialic acid catabolism in humans remains unclear. Here, we present evidence that sialic acid catabolism is important for heart and skeletal muscle function and development in humans and zebrafish. In two siblings, presenting with sialuria, exercise intolerance/muscle wasting, and cardiac symptoms in the brother, compound heterozygous mutations [chr1:182775324C{\textgreater}T (c.187C{\textgreater}T; p.Arg63Cys) and chr1:182772897A{\textgreater}G (c.133A{\textgreater}G; p.Asn45Asp)] were found in the N-acetylneuraminate pyruvate lyase gene (NPL). In vitro, NPL activity and sialic acid catabolism were affected, with a cell-type-specific reduction of N-acetyl mannosamine (ManNAc). A knockdown of NPL in zebrafish resulted in severe skeletal myopathy and cardiac edema, mimicking the human phenotype. The phenotype was rescued by expression of wild-type human NPL but not by the p.Arg63Cys or p.Asn45Asp mutants. Importantly, the myopathy phenotype in zebrafish embryos was rescued by treatment with the catabolic products of NPL: N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) and ManNAc; the latter also rescuing the cardiac phenotype. In conclusion, we provide the first report to our knowledge of a human defect in sialic acid catabolism, which implicates an important role of the sialic acid catabolic pathway in mammalian muscle physiology, and suggests opportunities for monosaccharide replacement therapy in human patients.},

Previous assessment by a neurologist and/or clinical geneticist, including biochemical testing, neuroimaging, and chromosomal microarray, did not yield an etiologic diagnosis.
RESULTS: A precise molecular diagnosis was established in 65\% of the 50 patients. We also identified candidate disease genes without a current OMIM disease designation. Targeted intervention was enabled in eight families ({\textasciitilde}15\%).
CONCLUSION: NGS enabled a molecular diagnosis in ACP cases, ending the diagnostic odyssey, improving genetic counseling and personalized management, all in all enhancing precision medicine practices.},

	abstract = {Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major problem in modern medicine, representing up to the fourth-highest cause of mortality. Pharmacogenomic tests are 1 of the most promising methods to tackle the challenge of ADRs. The objective of this study was to analyze the clinical and demographic information of the pan-Canadian active surveillance network, Canadian Pharmacogenomics Network for Drug Safety (CPNDS). Information entered into the database by trained active surveillors between May 15, 2005 and May 9, 2017 was collected and analyzed. Specific data included for analysis were number of ADR reports, reports of drug use without ADRs, date of onset of ADR, suspected drugs, concomitant drugs, and fatal ADR cases. The CPNDS database consisted of 93,974 reports of medication use, including 10,475 reports of ADRs, of which 72.6\% occurred in pediatric patients (≤21 years old). Self-reported ancestries were predominantly Europe (38.2\%), Canada (9.6\%), and East Asia (4.9\%). The 5 most frequent ADRs were cutaneous ADRs, peripheral neuropathy, cardiotoxicity, central nervous system toxicity, and ototoxicity. The 5 drugs most commonly suspected to cause ADRs were methotrexate, vincristine, doxorubicin, cisplatin, and L-asparaginase. The CPNDS database is a valuable resource to identify clinical and genomic predictors of ADRs. The database also highlights our candidate ADRs for pharmacogenomic discovery research to identify additional ADR biomarkers. Additionally, the database provides information that can be used for developing strategies to prevent ADRs and raises awareness of ADRs among Canadian healthcare professionals.},

Unfortunately, between 30 and 50\% of patients receiving this hormonal therapy relapse. Since CYP2D6 genetic variants have been reported to play an important role in survival outcomes after treatment with tamoxifen, this study sought to summarize and critically appraise the available scientific evidence on this topic.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify studies investigating associations between CYP2D6 genetic variation and survival outcomes after tamoxifen treatment. Critical appraisal of the retrieved scientific evidence was performed, and recommendations were developed for CYP2D6 genetic testing in the context of tamoxifen therapy.
RESULTS: Although conflicting literature exists, the majority of the current evidence points toward CYP2D6 genetic variation affecting survival outcomes after tamoxifen treatment. Of note, review of the CYP2D6 genotyping assays used in each of the studies revealed the importance of comprehensive genotyping strategies to accurately predict CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotypes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Critical appraisal of the literature provided evidence for the value of comprehensive CYP2D6 genotyping panels in guiding treatment decisions for non-metastatic ER-positive breast cancer patients. Based on this information, it is recommended that alternatives to standard tamoxifen treatments may be considered in CYP2D6 poor or intermediate metabolizers.},

Whole-exome sequencing and conventional Sanger sequencing identified heterozygous de novo mutations in the catalytic Na+, K+-ATPase α1 subunit (ATP1A1). Functional characterization of mutant Na+, K+-ATPase α1 subunits in heterologous expression systems revealed not only a loss of Na+, K+-ATPase function but also abnormal cation permeabilities, which led to membrane depolarization and possibly aggravated the effect of the loss of physiological pump activity. These findings underline the indispensable role of the α1 isoform of the Na+, K+-ATPase for renal-tubular magnesium handling and cellular ion homeostasis, as well as maintenance of physiologic neuronal activity.},

Analysis of an independent cohort of IFN-β-treated MS patients identified via electronic medical records showed that rs2205986 was also associated with increased peak levels of aspartate aminotransferase (P = 7.6 × 10-5) and alkaline phosphatase (P = 4.9 × 10-4).

Whole-exome sequencing of the patient's DNA revealed a heterozygous de novo variant in the KCNJ6 (c.512T{\textgreater}G, p.Leu171Arg). We conducted in vitro functional studies to determine if this Leu-to-Arg mutation alters the function of GIRK2 channels. Heterologous expression of the mutant GIRK2 channel alone produced an aberrant basal inward current that lacked G protein activation, lost K+ selectivity and gained Ca2+ permeability. Notably, the inward current was inhibited by the Na+ channel blocker QX-314, similar to the previously reported weaver mutation in murine GIRK2. Expression of a tandem dimer containing GIRK1 and GIRK2(p.Leu171Arg) did not lead to any currents, suggesting heterotetramers are not functional. In neurons expressing p.Leu171Arg GIRK2 channels, these changes in channel properties would be expected to generate a sustained depolarization, instead of the normal G protein-gated inhibitory response, which could be mitigated by expression of other GIRK subunits. The identification of the p.Leu171Arg GIRK2 mutation potentially expands the Keppen-Lubinsky syndrome phenotype to include severe dystonia and ballismus. Our study suggests screening for dominant KCNJ6 mutations in the evaluation of patients with severe movement disorders, which could provide evidence to support a causal role of KCNJ6 in neurological channelopathies.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Adverse drug reactions such as ototoxicity, which occurs in approximately one-fifth of adult patients who receive cisplatin treatment, can incur large socioeconomic burdens on patients with testicular cancer who develop this cancer during early adulthood. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants in ACYP2 and WFS1 that are associated with cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. We sought to explore the role of these genetic susceptibility factors to cisplatin-induced ototoxicity in patients with testicular cancer.Experimental Design: Extensive clinical and demographic data were collected for 229 patients with testicular cancer treated with cisplatin. Patients were genotyped for two variants, ACYP2 rs1872328 and WFS1 rs62283056, that have previously been associated with hearing loss in cisplatin-treated patients. Analyses were performed to investigate the association of these variants with ototoxicity in this cohort of adult patients with testicular cancer.Results: Pharmacogenomic analyses revealed that ACYP2 rs1872328 was significantly associated with cisplatin-induced ototoxicity [P = 2.83 × 10-3, OR (95\% CI):14.7 (2.6-84.2)]. WFS1 rs62283056 was not significantly associated with ototoxicity caused by cisplatin (P = 0.39); however, this variant was associated with hearing loss attributable to any cause [P = 5.67 × 10-3, OR (95\% CI): 3.2 (1.4-7.7)].Conclusions: This study has provided the first evidence for the role of ACYP2 rs1872328 in cisplatin-induced ototoxicity in patients with testicular cancer. These results support the use of this information to guide the development of strategies to prevent cisplatin-induced ototoxicity across cancers. Further, this study has highlighted the importance of phenotypic differences in replication studies and has provided further evidence for the role of WFS1 rs62283056 in susceptibility to hearing loss, which may be worsened by cisplatin treatment.

METHODS: We conducted a case-control genome-wide association study of autosomal genotypes, including Class I and II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, in 323 cases and 1,321 drug-tolerant controls from epilepsy cohorts of northern European and Han Chinese descent. Results from each cohort were meta-analyzed.
RESULTS: We report an association between a rare variant in the complement factor H-related 4 (CFHR4) gene and phenytoin-induced MPE in Europeans (p = 4.5 × 10-11; odds ratio [95\% confidence interval] 7 [3.2-16]). This variant is in complete linkage disequilibrium with a missense variant (N1050Y) in the complement factor H (CFH) gene. In addition, our results reinforce the association between HLA-A*31:01 and carbamazepine hypersensitivity. We did not identify significant genetic associations with MPE among Han Chinese patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The identification of genetic predictors of MPE in CFHR4 and CFH, members of the complement factor H-related protein family, suggest a new link between regulation of the complement system alternative pathway and phenytoin-induced hypersensitivity in European-ancestral patients.},

This variant was recently proposed as causal for the same condition in a consanguineous Chinese family. Compared to this family, the Afghan ethnic origin of our patient is distinct, yet the features are identical, validating the SIGMAR1 deficiency phenotype: progressive muscle wasting/weakness in lower and upper limbs without sensory loss.

	abstract = {Importance: Cisplatin-induced ototoxic effects are an important complication that affects testicular cancer survivors as a consequence of treatment. The identification of genetic variants associated with this adverse drug reaction will further our mechanistic understanding of its development and potentially lead to strategies to prevent ototoxic effects.
Objective: To identify the genetic variants associated with cisplatin-induced ototoxic effects in adult testicular cancer patients.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective study was performed by the Canadian Pharmacogenomics Network for Drug Safety using patients recruited from 5 adult oncology treatment centers across Canada. Male patients who were 17 years or older, diagnosed with germ cell testicular cancer, and previously treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy were recruited from July 2009 to April 2013 using active surveillance methodology. Cisplatin-induced ototoxic effects were independently diagnosed by 2 audiologists. Patients were genotyped for 7907 variants using a custom pharmacogenomic array. Logistic regression was used to identify genetic variants that were significantly associated with ototoxic effects. The validity of these findings was confirmed through independent replication and cell-based functional assays.
Exposures: Cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Cisplatin-induced ototoxic effects.
Results: After exclusions, 188 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 31 [24-39] years) were enrolled in this study to form the discovery and replication cohorts. Association and fine-mapping analyses identified a protein-coding variant, rs4788863 in SLC16A5, that was associated with protection against cisplatin-induced ototoxic effects in 2 independent cohorts (combined cohort: odds ratio, 0.06; 95\% CI, 0.02-0.22; P = 2.17 × 10-7). Functional validation of this transporter gene revealed that in vitro SLC16A5-silencing altered cellular responses to cisplatin treatment, supporting a role for SLC16A5 in the development of cisplatin-induced ototoxic effects. These results were further supported by the literature, which provided confirmatory evidence for the role that SLC16A5 plays in hearing.
Conclusions and Relevance: This study has identified a novel association between protein-coding variation in SLC16A5 and cisplatin-induced ototoxic effects. These findings have provided insight into the molecular mechanisms of this adverse drug reaction in adult patients with germ cell testicular cancer. Given that previous studies have shown that cimetidine, an SLC16A5-inhibitor, prevents murine cisplatin-induced ototoxic effects, the findings from this study have important implications for otoprotectant strategies in humans.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sialic acid storage diseases are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by accumulation of sialic acid in the lysosome. These disorders are caused by mutations in SLC17A5, the gene encoding sialin, a sialic acid transporter located in the lysosomal membrane. The most common form of sialic acid storage disease is the slowly progressive Salla disease, presenting with hypotonia, ataxia, epilepsy, nystagmus and findings of cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. Hypomyelination and corpus callosum hypoplasia are typical as well. We report a 16 year-old boy with an atypically mild clinical phenotype of sialic acid storage disease characterized by psychomotor retardation and a mixture of spasticity and rigidity but no ataxia, and only weak features of hypomyelination and thinning of corpus callosum on MRI of the brain.
RESULTS: The thiobarbituric acid method showed elevated levels of free sialic acid in urine and fibroblasts, indicating sialic acid storage disease. Initial Sanger sequencing of SLC17A5 coding regions did not show any pathogenic variants, although exon 9 could not be sequenced. Whole exome sequencing followed by RNA and genomic DNA analysis identified a homozygous 6040 bp insertion in intron 9 of SLC17A5 corresponding to a long interspersed element-1 retrotransposon (KF425758.1). This insertion adds two splice sites, both resulting in a frameshift which in turn creates a premature stop codon 4 bp into intron 9.
CONCLUSIONS: This study describes a novel pathogenic variant in SLC17A5, namely an intronic transposal insertion, in a patient with mild biochemical and clinical phenotypes. The presence of a small fraction of normal transcript may explain the mild phenotype. This case illustrates the importance of including lysosomal sialic acid storage disease in the differential diagnosis of developmental delay with postnatal onset and hypomyelination, as well as intronic regions in the genetic investigation of inborn errors of metabolism.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whole-exome sequencing has transformed gene discovery and diagnosis in rare diseases. Translation into disease-modifying treatments is challenging, particularly for intellectual developmental disorder. However, the exception is inborn errors of metabolism, since many of these disorders are responsive to therapy that targets pathophysiological features at the molecular or cellular level.
METHODS: To uncover the genetic basis of potentially treatable inborn errors of metabolism, we combined deep clinical phenotyping (the comprehensive characterization of the discrete components of a patient's clinical and biochemical phenotype) with whole-exome sequencing analysis through a semiautomated bioinformatics pipeline in consecutively enrolled patients with intellectual developmental disorder and unexplained metabolic phenotypes.
RESULTS: We performed whole-exome sequencing on samples obtained from 47 probands. Of these patients, 6 were excluded, including 1 who withdrew from the study. The remaining 41 probands had been born to predominantly nonconsanguineous parents of European descent. In 37 probands, we identified variants in 2 genes newly implicated in disease, 9 candidate genes, 22 known genes with newly identified phenotypes, and 9 genes with expected phenotypes; in most of the genes, the variants were classified as either pathogenic or probably pathogenic. Complex phenotypes of patients in five families were explained by coexisting monogenic conditions. We obtained a diagnosis in 28 of 41 probands (68\%) who were evaluated. A test of a targeted intervention was performed in 18 patients (44\%).
CONCLUSIONS: Deep phenotyping and whole-exome sequencing in 41 probands with intellectual developmental disorder and unexplained metabolic abnormalities led to a diagnosis in 68\%, the identification of 11 candidate genes newly implicated in neurometabolic disease, and a change in treatment beyond genetic counseling in 44\%.

	doi = {10.1097/FPC.0000000000000213},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although antipsychotics are integral to the treatment of schizophrenia, drug efficacy varies between patients. Although it has been shown that antipsychotic treatment response outcomes are heritable, our understanding of the genetic factors that are involved remains incomplete. Therefore, this study aims to use an unbiased scan of the genome to identify the genetic variants contributing toward antipsychotic treatment response outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study utilized whole-exome sequencing of patients on extreme ends of the treatment response spectrum (n=11) in combination with results from previous antipsychotic studies to design a panel of variants that were genotyped in two well-characterized first-episode schizophrenia cohorts (n=103 and 87). Association analyses were carried out to determine whether these variants were significantly associated with antipsychotic treatment response outcomes.
RESULTS: Association analyses in the discovery cohort identified two nonsynonymous variants that were significantly associated with antipsychotic treatment response outcomes (P{\textless}2.7 × 10(-5)), which were also significantly associated with the corresponding treatment response outcome in an independent replication cohort. Computational approaches showed that both of these nonsynonymous variants--rs13025959 in MYO7B (E1647D) and rs10380 in MTRR (H622Y)--were predicted to impair the functioning of their corresponding protein products.
CONCLUSION: The use of whole-exome sequencing in a subset of patients from a well-characterized cohort of first-episode schizophrenia patients, for whom longitudinal depot treatment response data were available, allowed for (i) the removal of confounding factors related to treatment progression and compliance and (ii) the identification of two genetic variants that have not been associated previously with antipsychotic treatment response outcomes and whose results were applicable across different classes of antipsychotics. Although the genes that are affected by these variants are involved in pathways that have been related previously to antipsychotic treatment outcomes, the identification of these novel genes will play an important role in improving our understanding of the specific variants involved in antipsychotic treatment response outcomes.},

We measured EFV levels in hair from HIV-positive South African females who had been receiving EFV-based treatment for at least 3 months from the South African Black (SAB) (n = 81) and Cape Mixed Ancestry (CMA) (n = 53) populations. Common genetic variation in CYP2B6 was determined in 15 individuals from each population using bidirectional Sanger sequencing. Prioritized variants (n = 16) were subsequently genotyped in the entire patient cohort (n = 134). The predictive value of EFV levels in hair and selected variants in CYP2B6 on virological treatment outcomes was assessed. Previously described alleles (CYP2B6*2, CYP2B6*5, CYP2B6*6, CYP2B6*17, and CYP2B6*18), as well as two novel alleles (CYP2B6*31 and CYP2B6*32), were detected in this study. Compared to noncarriers, individuals homozygous for CYP2B6*6 had ∼109\% increased EFV levels in hair (p = .016) and CYP2B6*18 heterozygotes demonstrated 82\% higher EFV hair levels (p = .0006). This study confirmed that alleles affecting CYP2B6 metabolism and subsequent EFV exposure are present at significant frequencies in both the SAB and CMA populations. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that the use of hair samples for testing EFV concentrations may be a useful tool in determining long-term drug exposure in resource-limited countries.},

We describe the results of a genomic study of a girl with PEHO syndrome and review the literature on cases with a disease-causing variant in the same gene. Exome sequencing of the index and unaffected parents followed by Sanger confirmation identified nine candidate genes harboring nonsynonymous rare variants identified by trio whole-exome sequencing. The de novo variant, a missense variant (c.296C{\textgreater}T, p.(T99M)), affecting the motor domain of KIF1A was considered the pathogenic mutation. The literature review revealed 24 cases with disease-causing variants in the motor domain of KIF1A, of which three met all the criteria for PEHO syndrome and an additional patient with incomplete clinical data met four of the five criteria. If the criteria were modified to include cases with any convulsive disorder and less profound intellectual disability, a total of six patients met all five of the criteria, three patients met four of the criteria and six met three of the criteria. Our results indicate that the molecular basis for PEHO syndrome, in at least a subset of patients, is a dominant KIF1A variant affecting the motor domain of the protein. Variable expressivity is seen with recurrent variants causing the full phenotype of PEHO syndrome in some patients and in other patients, a partial or milder PEHO phenotype.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Large-scale whole genome and exome resequencing studies have revealed that humans have a high level of deleterious rare variation, which has important implications for the design of future pharmacogenetics studies.
AREAS COVERED: Current pharmacogenetic guidelines focus on the implementation of common variation into dosing guidelines. However, it is becoming apparent that rare variation may also play an important role in differential drug response. Current sequencing technologies offer the opportunity to examine rare variation, but there are many challenges associated with such analyses. Nonetheless, if a comprehensive picture of the role that genetic variants play in treatment outcomes is to be obtained, it will be necessary to include the entire spectrum of variation, including rare variants, into pharmacogenetic research.
EXPERT OPINION: In order to implement pharmacogenetics in the clinic, patients should be genotyped for clinically actionable pharmacogenetic variants and patients responding unfavourably to treatment after pharmacogenetics-based dosing should be identified and resequenced to identify additional functionally relevant variants, including rare variants. All derived information should be added to a central database to allow for the updating of existing dosing guidelines. By routinely implementing such strategies, pharmacogenetics-based treatment guidelines will continue to improve.},

	abstract = {AIM: Many antipsychotic pharmacogenetics studies have been performed examining candidate genes or known variation; however, our understanding of the genetic factors involved in antipsychotic pharmacogenetic traits remains limited.
MATERIALS \& METHODS: A well-characterized cohort of first-episode schizophrenia (FES) patients was used to identify a subset of nonresponders and responders to antipsychotic treatment for exome sequencing (n = 11). The variation observed in the responders and nonresponders was subsequently compared and a prioritization strategy was employed to identify variants for genotyping in the entire FES cohort (n = 103) as well as an additional Xhosa schizophrenia cohort (n = 222).
RESULTS: Examination of coding variation revealed a potential role for rare loss-of-function variants in treatment response outcomes. One variant, rs11368509, was found to be weakly associated with better treatment outcomes in the FES cohort (p = 0.057) and the Xhosa schizophrenia cohort (p = 0.016). In addition, the majority of the loss-of-function variation that was considered likely to be involved in antipsychotic treatment response was either novel or rare in Asian and European populations.
CONCLUSION: This pilot study has highlighted the importance of exome sequencing for antipsychotic pharmacogenomics studies, particularly in African individuals. Furthermore, the results emphasize once again the complexity of antipsychotic pharmacogenomics and the need for future research.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Because of the unmet needs of current pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia, antipsychotic pharmacogenetic research is of utmost importance. However, to date, few clinically applicable antipsychotic pharmacogenomic alleles have been identified. Nonetheless, next-generation sequencing technologies are expected to aid in the identification of clinically significant variants for this complex phenotype. The aim of this study was therefore to critically examine the ability of next-generation sequencing technologies to reliably detect variation present in pharmacogenes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Candidate antipsychotic pharmacogenes and very important pharmacogenes were identified from the literature and the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase. Thereafter, the percentage sequence similarity observed between these genes and their corresponding pseudogenes and paralogues, as well as the percentage low-complexity sequence and GC content of each gene, was calculated. These sequence attributes were subsequently compared with the 'inaccessible' regions of these genes as described by the 1000 Genomes Project.
RESULTS: It was found that the percentage 'inaccessible genome' correlated well with GC content (P=9.96×10), low-complexity sequence (P=0.0002) and the presence of pseudogenes/paralogues (P=8.02×10). In addition, it was found that many of the pharmacogenes were not ideally suited to next-generation sequencing because of these genomic complexities. These included the CYP and HLA genes, both of which are of importance to many fields of pharmacogenetics.
CONCLUSION: Current short read sequencing technologies are unable to comprehensively capture the variation in all pharmacogenes. Therefore, until high-throughput sequencing technologies advance further, it may be necessary to combine next-generation sequencing with other genotyping strategies.},

	abstract = {The CYP3A4 enzyme is the most abundant human cytochrome P450 (CYP) and is regarded as the most important enzyme involved in drug metabolism. Inter-individual and inter-population variability in gene expression and enzyme activity are thought to be influenced, in part, by genetic variation. Although Southern African individuals have been shown to exhibit the highest levels of genetic diversity, they have been under-represented in pharmacogenetic research to date. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify genetic variation within CYP3A4 in three South African population groups comprising of 29 Khoisan, 65 Xhosa and 65 Mixed Ancestry (MA) individuals. To identify known and novel CYP3A4 variants, 15 individuals were randomly selected from each of the population groups for bi-directional Sanger sequencing of {\textasciitilde}600 bp of the 5'-upstream region and all thirteen exons including flanking intronic regions. Genetic variants detected were genotyped in the rest of the cohort. In total, 24 SNPs were detected, including CYP3A4(*)12, CYP3A4(*)15, and the reportedly functional CYP3A4(*)1B promoter polymorphism, as well as two novel non-synonymous variants. These putatively functional variants, p.R162W and p.Q200H, were present in two of the three populations and all three populations, respectively, and in silico analysis predicted that the former would damage the protein product. Furthermore, the three populations were shown to exhibit distinct genetic profiles. These results confirm that South African populations show unique patterns of variation in the genes encoding xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes. This research suggests that population-specific genetic profiles for CYP3A4 and other drug metabolizing genes would be essential to make full use of pharmacogenetics in Southern Africa. Further investigation is needed to determine if the identified genetic variants influence CYP3A4 metabolism phenotype in these populations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adverse drug reactions and lack of therapeutic efficacy associated with currently prescribed pharmacotherapeutics may be attributed, in part, to inter-individual variability in drug metabolism. Studies on the pharmacogenetics of Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes offer insight into this variability. The objective of this study was to compare the AmpliChip CYP450 Test® (AmpliChip) to alternative genotyping platforms for phenotype prediction of CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 in a representative cohort of the South African population.
METHODS: AmpliChip was used to screen for thirty-three CYP2D6 and three CYP2C19 alleles in two different cohorts. As a comparison cohort 2 was then genotyped using a CYP2D6 specific long range PCR with sequencing (CYP2D6 XL-PCR + Sequencing) platform and a PCR-RFLP platform for seven CYP2C19 alleles.
RESULTS: Even though there was a low success rate for the AmpliChip, allele frequencies for both CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 were very similar between the two different cohorts. The CYP2D6 XL-PCR + Sequencing platform detected CYP2D6*5 more reliably and could correctly distinguish between CYP2D6*2 and *41 in the Black African individuals. Alleles not covered by the AmpliChip were identified and four novel CYP2D6 alleles were also detected. CYP2C19 PCR-RFLP identified CYP2C19*9,*15, *17 and *27 in the Black African individuals, with *2, *17 and *27 being relatively frequent in the cohort. Eliminating mismatches and identifying additional alleles will contribute to improving phenotype prediction for both enzymes. Phenotype prediction differed between platforms for both genes.
CONCLUSION: Comprehensive genotyping of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 with the platforms used in this study, would be more appropriate than AmpliChip for phenotypic prediction in the South African population. Pharmacogenetically important novel alleles may remain undiscovered when using assays that are designed according to Caucasian specific variation, unless alternate strategies are utilised.},

	abstract = {The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene is an attractive schizophrenia candidate gene, encoding a catabolic dopamine enzyme. The enzyme exists as two distinct isoforms, with the membrane bound enzyme (i.e. MB-COMT) being predominantly expressed in the brain. Since African populations remain underrepresented in genetic/genomic research, we performed an association study to determine whether MB-COMT genetic variants are associated with schizophrenia-susceptibility and symptom severity in the South African Xhosa population. Fourteen candidate polymorphisms were selected by means of a literature search and in silico analyses and were subsequently genotyped in a cohort of 238 Xhosa schizophrenia patients and 240 healthy Xhosa controls. Genetic association was tested with schizophrenia-susceptibility as well as symptom severity within the patient group. Polymorphisms of interest were also analysed using functional assays. Two SNPs, rs2020917 (OR=0.54, 95\% CI 0.37-0.79; P=0.0011) and rs737865 (OR=0.52, 95\% CI 0.36-0.74; P=0.0002), in the P2 promoter region were significantly associated with schizophrenia as well as an increase (increase=11.2\%, 95\% CI 3.7\%-19.2\%; P=0.0031) in reporter gene expression. The minor alleles of these SNPs were underrepresented in the schizophrenia cohort, indicating a possible protective effect. The P2 region also formed part of a haplotype found to be associated with the severity of the negative symptoms of the disorder. The data generated by this study indicate that genetic variation of MB-COMT could be associated with schizophrenia and negative symptom severity in the Xhosa population and may therefore be one of the genomic loci contributing towards the disorder in the South African community. Future large-scale studies in other African schizophrenia populations are required to further elucidate the significance of these findings.},

	abstract = {South Africa, like many other developing countries, stands to benefit from novel diagnostics and drugs developed by pharmacogenomics guidance due to high prevalence of disease burden in the region. This includes both communicable (e.g., HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis) and non-communicable (e.g., diabetes and cardiovascular) diseases. For example, although only 0.7\% of the world's population lives in South Africa, the country carries 17\% of the global HIV/AIDS burden and 5\% of the global tuberculosis burden. Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu has coined the term Rainbow Nation, referring to a land of wealth in its many diverse peoples and cultures. It is now timely and necessary to reflect on how best to approach new genomics biotechnologies in a manner that carefully considers the public health needs and extant disease burden in the region. The aim of this paper is to document and review the advances in pharmacogenomics in South Africa and importantly, to evaluate the direction that future research should take. Previous research has shown that the populations in South Africa exhibit unique allele frequencies and novel genetic variation in pharmacogenetically relevant genes, often differing from other African and global populations. The high level of genetic diversity, low linkage disequilibrium and the presence of rare variants in these populations question the feasibility of the use of current commercially available genotyping platforms, and may partially account for genotype-phenotype discordance observed in past studies. However, the employment of high throughput technologies for genomic research, within the context of large clinical trials, combined with interdisciplinary studies and appropriate regulatory guidelines, should aid in acceleration of pharmacogenomic discoveries in high priority therapeutic areas in South Africa. Finally, we suggest that projects such as the H3Africa Initiative, the SAHGP and PGENI should play an integral role in the coordination of genomic research in South Africa, but also other African countries, by providing infrastructure and capital to local researchers, as well as providing aid in addressing the computational and statistical bottlenecks encountered at present.},

Incorporating genetic technologies into future treatment plans offers a potential mechanism to reduce this burden. This review focuses on psychiatric genetic research that has been performed in South African populations with regards to obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Preliminary findings from these studies suggest that data obtained in developed countries cannot necessarily be extrapolated to South African population groups. Psychiatric genetic studies in South Africa seem to involve relatively low-cost methodologies and only a limited number of large national collaborative studies. Future research in South Africa should therefore aim to incorporate high-throughput technologies into large scale psychiatric studies through the development of collaborations. On a global level, the vast majority of psychiatric genetic studies have been performed in non-African populations. South Africa, as the leading contributor to scientific research in Africa, may provide a foundation for addressing this disparity and strengthening psychiatric genetic research on the continent. Although the elucidation of the genetic architecture of psychiatric disorders has proved challenging, examining the unique genetic profiles found in South African populations could provide valuable insight into the genetics of psychiatric disorders.},

It can be argued that this disproportionate research is related to the fact that the genome architecture of African individuals is poorly suited to SNP-based genome-wide association studies, given existing genotyping platforms. However, this argument is no longer plausible with the arrival of next-generation sequencing technologies, which allow for the analysis of entire genomes. Using pharmacogenes to critically examine the merit of next-generation sequencing technologies in pharmacogenomics, we found a substantial amount of novel/uncharacterized variation, which was predicted to alter protein function. This variation was predominantly observed in African individuals, emphasizing the benefit of next-generation sequencing technologies specifically for these individuals. We also observed an improvement in the reliability of sequencing technologies in a relatively short time. Therefore, as sequencing technologies develop and decrease in cost, the ability to reliably detect variation will improve and these technologies will begin to replace other less comprehensive genotyping assays.},

Clinically, VP is characterized by photosensitivity and acute neurovisceral attacks that can manifest separately or together in affected individuals. The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with incomplete penetrance and PPOX gene mutations associated with VP are usually unique to patients and their families. In South Africa, however, VP is highly prevalent as the result of a founder mutation, designated p.R59W. Previous genealogical and haplotype studies showed a link between South African and Dutch carriers of p.R59W and it was suggested that this mutation was introduced to South Africa by Dutch settlers at the end of the 17th century.
OBJECTIVES: To perform extended haplotype analysis in six South African and Dutch VP families with the p.R59W mutation.
METHODS: Haplotyping of 13 microsatellite markers flanking the PPOX gene on chromosome 1q22-23 and five informative single nucleotide polymorphisms within and around the gene.
RESULTS: A core haplotype cosegregated in all families studied.
