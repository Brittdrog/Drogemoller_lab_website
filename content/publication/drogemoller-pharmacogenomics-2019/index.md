#abstract: "Cisplatin is a highly effective chemotherapeutic. Unfortunately, its use is limited by cisplatin-induced ototoxicity (CIO). Substantial research has been performed to uncover the genetic variants associated with CIO; however, there has been a lack of consistency in the results that have been reported. This paper aims to provide an overview of the current state of CIO genomics research, delving into the shortcomings of past research, and providing recommendations for future avenues of study."
