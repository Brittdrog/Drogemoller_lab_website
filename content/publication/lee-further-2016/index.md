#abstract: "Distal hereditary motor neuropathies represent a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by progressive distal motor weakness without sensory loss. Their genetic heterogeneity is high and thus eligible for diagnostic whole exome sequencing. The authors report successful application of whole exome sequencing in diagnosing a second consanguineous family with distal hereditary motor neuropathy due to a homozygous c.151+1GtextgreaterT variant in SIGMAR1. This variant was recently proposed as causal for the same condition in a consanguineous Chinese family. Compared to this family, the Afghan ethnic origin of our patient is distinct, yet the features are identical, validating the SIGMAR1 deficiency phenotype: progressive muscle wasting/weakness in lower and upper limbs without sensory loss. Rapid disease progression during adolescent growth is similar and may be due to SIGMAR1's role in regulating axon elongation and tau phosphorylation. Finally, the authors conclude that SIGMAR1 deficiency should be added to the differential diagnosis of distal hereditary motor neuropathies."
