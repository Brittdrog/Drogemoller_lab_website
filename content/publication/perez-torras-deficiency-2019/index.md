#abstract: "Pyrimidine nucleotides are essential for a vast number of cellular processes and dysregulation of pyrimidine metabolism has been associated with a variety of clinical abnormalities. Inborn errors of pyrimidine metabolism affecting enzymes in the pyrimidine de novo and degradation pathway have been identified but no patients have been described with a deficiency in proteins affecting the cellular import of ribonucleosides. In this manuscript, we report the elucidation of the genetic basis of the observed uridine-cytidineuria in a patient presenting with fever, hepatosplenomegaly, persistent lactate acidosis, severely disturbed liver enzymes and ultimately multi-organ failure. Sequence analysis of genes encoding proteins directly involved in the metabolism of uridine and cytidine showed two variants c.1528C textgreater T (p.R510C) and c.1682G textgreater A (p.R561Q) in SLC28A1, encoding concentrative nucleotide transporter 1 (hCNT1). Functional analysis showed that these variants affected the three-dimensional structure of hCNT1, altered glycosylation and decreased the half-life of the mutant proteins which resulted in impaired transport activity. Co-transfection of both variants, mimicking the trans disposition of c.1528C textgreater T (p.R510C) and c.1682G textgreater A (p.R561Q) in the patient, significantly impaired hCNT1 biological function. Whole genome sequencing identified two pathogenic variants c.50delT; p.(Leu17Argfs*34) and c.853_855del; p.(Lys285del) in the PRF1 gene, indicating that our patient was also suffering from Familial Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis type 2. The identification of two co-existing monogenic defects might have resulted in a blended phenotype. Thus, the clinical presentation of isolated hCNT1 deficiency remains to be established."
