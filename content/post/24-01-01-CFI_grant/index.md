We are excited to establish the Precision Genomics Suite, the first of its kind in Manitoba, which will enable the seamless integration of multi-omics, whole transcriptome spatial sequencing, and high resolution targeted spatial sequencing workflows at the single-cell and sub-cellular level using the following equipment
- Chromium iX (single cell sequencing library preparation)
- Visium CytAssist (prepares Visium slides for spatial sequencing studies)
- Xenium Analyzer (in situ spatial studies)
