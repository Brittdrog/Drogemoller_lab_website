Some key find from this work below:
- Our TWAS uncovered an association between imputed *ARL14EP* expression and PCOS in two independent cohorts. We validated these findings by examining measured *ARL14EP* expression in a third PCOS cohort.
- Colocalization analyses revealed tissue-specific eQTLs patterns - high evidence of colocalization was observed for the *ARL14EP*-testis-PCOS triplet. As hyperandrogenism is a defining feature of PCOS, future studies should investigate how testosterone modulates the effects of *ALR14EP* eQTLs.
- We showed that PCOS-associated *ARL14EP* eQTLs occur in an *ARL14EP* divergent transcript. Antisense lncRNAs can influence the expression of their coding gene counterparts. Future stdies should investigate the link between PCOS-associated variants, *ARL14EP-DT* function and *ARL14EP* expression. 
- *ARL14EP* has been shown to play an important role in chromatin remodelling. Annotation analyses revealed that *ARL14EP* occurs within a region where extensive chromatin interactions are observed, including interactions with *FSHB*.

- While none of the gene prioritization analyses prioritized *FSHB* as a likely causal gene, FSH levels are important in PCOS! Single cell multiomics analyses will provide improved insight into how *FHSB*, *ARL14EP* and *ARL14EP-DT* interact in the relevant cells in the context of PCOS.
