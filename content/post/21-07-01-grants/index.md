These funds will be used to support work aimed at predicting and preventing hearing loss caused by the chemotherapeutic agent, cisplatin. These funds will allow us to develop polygenic risk scores to predict cisplatin-induced ototoxicity; use genomics-driven drug repurposing to identify novel otoprotectants to prevent and cisplatin-induced ototoxicity; and harness single cell RNA sequencing to identify cisplatin-induced changes in gene expression that occur in murine inner ear cells.
