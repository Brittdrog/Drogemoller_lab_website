Sarah was a Genetic Honours Co-op student in the Drögemöller lab, where she focused on identifying genetic variants associated with polycystic ovary syndrome and their role in treatment outcomes of patients. In her current role as a lab technician, she is developing polygenic scores that can be applied in the context of pharmacogenomics.
