	abstract = {Anthracyclines are highly effective chemotherapeutic agents; however, their clinical utility is limited by severe anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (ACT). Genome-wide  association studies (GWAS) have uncovered several genetic variants associated with  ACT, but the impact of these findings requires further elucidation. We conducted a  transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) using our previous GWAS summary  statistics (n = 280 patients) to identify gene expression-related associations with  ACT. We identified a genetic association between decreased expression of GDF5 and  ACT (Z-score = -4.30, P = 1.70 × 10(-5)), which was replicated in an independent  cohort (n = 845 patients, P = 3.54 × 10(-3)). Additionally, cell viability of  GDF5-silenced human cardiac myocytes was significantly decreased in response to  anthracycline treatment. Subsequent gene set enrichment and pathway analyses of the  TWAS data revealed that genes essential for survival, cardioprotection and response  to anthracyclines, as well as genes involved in ribosomal, spliceosomal and  cardiomyopathy pathways are important for the development of ACT.},

	abstract = {Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency is a creatine deficiency disorder and an inborn error of metabolism presenting with progressive intellectual  and neurological deterioration. As most cases are identified and treated in early  childhood, adult phenotypes that can help in understanding the natural history of  the disorder are rare. We describe two adult cases of GAMT deficiency from a  consanguineous family in Pakistan that presented with a history of global  developmental delay, cognitive impairments, excessive drooling, behavioral  abnormalities, contractures and apparent bone deformities initially presumed to be  the reason for abnormal gait. Exome sequencing identified a homozygous nonsense  variant in GAMT: NM\_000156.5:c.134G{\textgreater}A (p.Trp45*). We also performed a literature  review and compiled the genetic and clinical characteristics of all adult cases of  GAMT deficiency reported to date. When compared to the adult cases previously  reported, the musculoskeletal phenotype and the rapidly progressive nature of  neurological and motor decline seen in our patients is striking. This study presents  an opportunity to gain insights into the adult presentation of GAMT deficiency and  highlights the need for in-depth evaluation and reporting of clinical features to  expand our understanding of the phenotypic spectrum.},

Results: Using genome-wide association  studies summary statistics from the UK Biobank, European Bioinformatics Institute  genome-wide association studies catalog and the Pharmacogenomics Research Network,  we validated pleiotropy at the ABCG2 locus between allopurinol response and gout and  identified novel pleiotropy between antihypertensive-induced new-onset diabetes,  Crohn's disease and inflammatory bowel disease at the IL18RAP/SLC9A4 locus.  Conclusion: New mechanistic insights and genetic loci can be uncovered by  identifying pleiotropy between disease and drug-related traits.},

	abstract = {Bioinformatics pipelines for calling star alleles (haplotypes) in cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes are important for the implementation of precision medicine. Genotyping  CYP genes using high throughput sequencing data is complicated, e.g., by being  highly polymorphic, not to mention the structural variations especially in CYP2D6,  CYP2A6, and CYP2B6. Genome graph-based variant detection approaches have been shown  to be reliable for genotyping HLA alleles. However, their application to enhancing  star allele calling in CYP genes has not been extensively explored. We present  StellarPGx, a Nextflow pipeline for accurately genotyping CYP genes by combining  genome graph-based variant detection, read coverage information from the original  reference-based alignments, and combinatorial diplotype assignments. The  implementation of StellarPGx using Nextflow facilitates its portability,  reproducibility, and scalability on various user platforms. StellarPGx is currently  able to genotype 12 important pharmacogenes belonging to the CYP1, 2, and 3  families. For purposes of validation, we use CYP2D6 as a model gene owing to its  high degree of polymorphisms (over 130 star alleles defined to date, including  complex structural variants) and clinical importance. We applied StellarPGx and  three existing callers to 109 whole genome sequenced samples for which the Genetic  Testing Reference Material Coordination Program (GeT-RM) has recently provided  consensus truth CYP2D6 diplotypes. StellarPGx had the highest CYP2D6 diplotype  concordance (99\%) with GeT-RM compared with Cyrius (98\%), Aldy (82\%), and Stargazer  (84\%). This exemplifies the high accuracy of StellarPGx and highlights its  importance for both research and clinical pharmacogenomics applications. The  StellarPGx pipeline is open-source and available from  https://github.com/SBIMB/StellarPGx.},

	abstract = {Genetic variation in genes encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes has important clinical implications for drug metabolism. Bioinformatics algorithms for genotyping these  highly polymorphic genes using high-throughput sequence data and automating  phenotype prediction have recently been developed. The CYP2D6 gene is often used as  a model during the validation of these algorithms due to its clinical importance,  high polymorphism, and structural variations. However, the validation process is  often limited to common star alleles due to scarcity of reference datasets. In  addition, there has been no comprehensive benchmark of these algorithms to date. We  performed a systematic comparison of three star allele calling algorithms using 4618  simulations as well as 75 whole-genome sequence samples from the GeT-RM project.  Overall, we found that Aldy and Astrolabe are better suited to call both common and  rare diplotypes compared to Stargazer, which is affected by population structure.  Aldy was the best performing algorithm in calling CYP2D6 structural variants  followed by Stargazer, whereas Astrolabe had limitations especially in calling  hybrid rearrangements. We found that ensemble genotyping, characterised by taking a  consensus of genotypes called by all three algorithms, has higher haplotype  concordance but it is prone to ambiguities whenever complete discrepancies between  the tools arise. Further, we evaluated the effects of sequencing coverage and indel  misalignment on genotyping accuracy. Our account of the strengths and limitations of  these algorithms is extremely important to clinicians and researchers in the  pharmacogenomics and precision medicine communities looking to haplotype CYP2D6 and  other pharmacogenes using high-throughput sequencing data.},
