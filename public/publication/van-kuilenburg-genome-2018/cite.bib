 abstract = {Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency is associated with a variable clinical presentation. A family with three DPD-deficient patients presented with unusual clinical phenotypes including pregnancy-induced symptoms, transient visual impairment, severe developmental delay, cortical blindness, and delayed myelination in the brain. DPYD Sanger sequencing showed heterozygosity for the c.1905+1G\textgreaterA mutation and a novel missense variant c.1700G\textgreaterA (p.G567E). The recombinantly expressed p.G567E DPD variant showed increased temperature lability probably caused by structural rearrangements within the DPD protein. Genome sequencing of the affected son established compound heterozygosity for the c.1700G\textgreaterA and an imperfect 115,731 bp inversion with breakpoints at chr1: 98,113,121 (intron 8) and chr1: 97,997,390 (intron 12) of the DPYD associated with a 4 bp deletion (chr1: 97,997,386_97,997,389del). Whole exome and mitochondrial DNA analyses for the mother and daughter did not reveal additional mutated genes of significance. Thus, an inversion in DPYD should be considered in patients with an inconclusive genotype or unusual clinical phenotype.},
