 abstract = {AIM: To align predicted and measured CYP2C19 phenotype in a South African cohort.
MATERIALS & METHODS: Genotyping of CYP2C19*2, *3, *9, *15, *17, *27 and *28 was performed using PCR-RFLP, and an activity score (AS) system was used to predict phenotype. True phenotype was measured using plasma concentrations of omeprazole and its metabolite 5'-hydroxyomperazole.
RESULTS: Partial genotype-phenotype discrepancies were reported, and an adapted AS system was developed, which showed a marked improvement in phenotype prediction. Results highlight the need for a more comprehensive CYP2C19 genotyping approach to improve prediction of omeprazole metabolism.
CONCLUSION: Evidence for the utility of a CYP2C19 AS system is provided, for which the accuracy can be further improved by means of comprehensive genotyping and substrate-specific modification.},
