      <title>The first article from the Drögemöller Lab is out!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A great start to 2022, with the publication of our first article! Under the joint leadership of Danielle, MacKenzie and Sarah, we performed a systematic review and analysis of the current use of polygenic scores in pharmacogenomics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some key find from this work are highlighted below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The development of PGx PGS is limited by a lack of large PGx cohorts. To overcome these challenges current studies are using PGS derived from non-drug related phenotypes. Large PGx consortiums are required to overcome these sample size limitations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A wide range of methods are currently being used to develop PGx PGS. Inconsistencies in reporting of methods complicates replication of findings. Future publications should adhere to PGS reporting standards: 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03243-6&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03243-6&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/PRS-RS.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lack of representation of authors from across the globe is contributing to the lack of diversity in participants that are included in PGx PGS research. We need to do better as a global community to prevent this research from increasing already existing health disparities
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/map.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last few months the Drögemöller Lab has received funding from &lt;strong&gt;CIHR&lt;/strong&gt; (Operating Grant: Early Career Investigators in Maternal, Reproductive, Child &amp;amp; Youth Health); &lt;strong&gt;Research Manitoba&lt;/strong&gt; (New Investigator Operating Grant) and the &lt;strong&gt;Health Sciences Centre Foundation&lt;/strong&gt; (General Operating Grant). We appreciate your support!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These funds will be used to support work aimed at predicting and preventing hearing loss caused by the chemotherapeutic agent, cisplatin. These funds will allow us to develop polygenic risk scores to predict cisplatin-induced ototoxicity; use genomics-driven drug repurposing to identify novel otoprotectants to prevent and cisplatin-induced ototoxicity; and harness single cell RNA sequencing to identify cisplatin-induced changes in gene expression that occur in murine inner ear cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Drögemöller and Wright labs receive Carnegie African Diaspora Fellowships for their Graduate Training and Collaborative Research in Neurogenomics and Precision Medicine application</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This funding has been provided to support a collaboration between the University of Manitoba and Stellenbosch University in South Africa to develop (i) a genomics analysis pipeline for the improved diagnosis and treatment of neurological diseases in Manitoba and South Africa and (ii) workshops aimed at training graduate students in Neurogenomics &amp;amp; Precision Medicine at the University of Manitoba, Canada and Stellenbosch University, South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advances in genomic technologies and related analyses provide unprecedented opportunities for the field of precision medicine. Importantly, these advances have resulted in improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological diseases. Unfortunately, African individuals have been under-represented in genomics research. Highlighting these disparities, it has been shown that although European descent individuals make up only 16% of the global population, they represent approximately 79% of participants that are included in genome-wide association studies. By developing international collaborations, as well as innovative graduate training strategies that merge the fields of neurogenomics and precision medicine, strategies can be developed to improve the diagnosis and treatment of neurological diseases in the context of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
